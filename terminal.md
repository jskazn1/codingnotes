# Terminal

### Basic stuff

`mkdir`: make directory

`cd x`: change directory into "x"
`cd ../` : go up one level

`ls`: list contents of directory

`rm x`: delete file "x"
`rm -rf x`: delete directory "x" 

`touch`: make a file called "x"

### Node

`npm install x`: installs a package into your current project.
The directory you are in needs a "package.json" file in it for this to work.

`create-react-app x`: make a new react project called "x"
